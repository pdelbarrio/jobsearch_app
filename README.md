# Job Search App

This React Native app was created to refresh skills and provide hands-on experience with Expo. During the development of this app, I focused on various aspects, including API requests, error handling, pagination, search functionality, routing, applying filters, creating custom hooks, implementing dynamic styling best practices, troubleshooting version compatibility issues with different packages, and staying updated with the latest documentation.

## API Usage

This app relies on a third-party job search API to fetch job listings. Please note that the API used is not free, and the free plan is almost consumed. You may need to upgrade your API plan or explore alternative data sources if the free quota is exhausted.

### 1. Main Screen

### 3. Search Results Screen
