# Job Search App

This React Native app was created to refresh skills and provide hands-on experience with Expo. During the development of this app, I focused on various aspects, including API requests, error handling, pagination, search functionality, routing, applying filters, creating custom hooks, implementing dynamic styling best practices, troubleshooting version compatibility issues with different packages, and staying updated with the latest documentation.

## API Usage

This app relies on a third-party job search API to fetch job listings. Please note that the API used is not free, and the free plan is almost consumed.

## Overview

This app serves as a job search platform with three primary screens:

### 1. Main Screen

- Features a search engine.
- Offers three filter buttons for job types: full-time, part-time, and contractor.
- Displays a list of jobs with the default query ('React in Barcelona').

### 2. Job Details Screen

- Shows detailed information for each job, including the title, company logo, and location.
- Provides three tab-like buttons: 'About,' 'Qualifications,' and 'Responsibilities' for viewing additional job details.
- Includes a favorites button (currently not enabled).
- Offers an 'Apply for job' button that opens a page for job applications.

### 3. Search Results Screen

- Displays the results of job searches, which can be based on the predetermined filters of the buttons of the Main Screen (full-time, part-time, contractor) or a manual search for specific technology or language.
